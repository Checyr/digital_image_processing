# Image Matrix Generator & Photomosaic Creator 🖼️🧩

Transform images into matrix representations and recreate them as stunning photomosaics! This Python program processes an input image to generate a pixel matrix and rebuilds it using smaller tile images, creating a visually striking mosaic effect.

## Requirements
You’ll need **Python** installed on your computer and a few dependencies.

### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9 or higher

- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation:

1. First ensure Python and pip are installed.

2. Then install the dependencies using this command:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
## How to Use

1. Prepare Images:
    - Move your desired input image to the Images folder.
    - Rename it to image_input.png.
    - Ensure your image meets these requirements:
        - Small dimensions (e.g., 40x30 pixels)
        - PNG format

>[!NOTE]
> Use tools like Krita or GIMP to resize/convert images if needed.

2. Run the Program:
    - Execute this command in your terminal:
  ```bash
    python main.py
  ```
